# Career-Compass
Career Compass is an AI-driven web application designed to help students and professionals discover their ideal career paths. It analyzes users’ skills, interests, and personality through an intelligent AI Career Quiz powered by the Google Gemini API, generating personalized recommendations and growth roadmaps.

The platform features a Smart Chatbot for instant career advice, a Dynamic Roadmap visualized with Chart.js, and an interactive Skill Tracker Dashboard to monitor progress. Users can also explore curated career resources and motivational quotes for continuous inspiration.

Built with Flask (Python) for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, Career Compass is lightweight, cost-effective, and easily deployable. Future enhancements include voice-based AI guidance, ML-based prediction models, and Firebase integration for scalability — making it a step toward personalized, accessible, and AI-powered career counseling.
